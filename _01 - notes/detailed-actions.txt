Need at least 12 different codes

Red alliance 1, 2, and 3 will be flipped later, this is just a basic reference for understanding the sides.
If we use some kind of device that will help auto level the robot, then the code will be added onto the code that goes onto the charge station
The robot will be facing towards the nodes, making placing the initial game piece easier.
Code will look differently depending on which program we use
We still need to figure out how the piece will be set into the node, whether with the claw set in or pushed in by some force




Blue Alliance Station 1
Plan for code
Set game piece in bottom node,  turn around to face away from community, then drive out of community (shortest of 3 drives)
Pseudocode
 
Blue Alliance Station 2
Plan for code
Set game piece in bottom node,  turn around to face away from community, then drive around charge station and out of community (least likely to happen)
Pseudocode

Blue Alliance Station 3
Plan for code
Set game piece in bottom node, turn around to face away from community, then drive out of community (further than station 1)
Pseudocode

Blue Alliance Station 1 (Onto Charge Station)
Plan for code
Set game piece into node, turn left, drive forward, turn left, drive onto charge station - then auto level on charge station
Pseudocode

Blue Alliance Station 2 (Onto Charge Station)
Plan for code
Set game piece into node, turn around to face charge station, then drive straight onto charge station - then auto level on charge station
Pseudocode

Blue Alliance Station 3 (Onto Charge Station)
Plan for code
Set game piece into node, turn right, drive forward, turn right, then drive onto charge station - then auto level on charge station
Pseudocode

Red Alliance Station 1
Plan for code
Set game piece in bottom node, turn around to face away from community, then drive out of community (shortest of 3 drives)
Pseudocode

Red Alliance Station 2
Plan for code
Set game piece in bottom node,  turn around to face away from community, then drive around charge station out of community (least likely to happen)
