Robot Movement:
- Since only basic track/tank constrols are required the provided API functions should be more than adequate
for acheiving movement 
- However, because there are three motors per side, some drive modes should be added to restrict/control how
fast the robot moves. Could code some of the buttoms on the joystick for fine movements. 
    If (mode == fine)
        reduce x/y joystick inputs by 90%

Turret: 
- Basic left right controls are all that is required. If needed a fine mode could also be added for this motor.

Arm:
- "At this point", the arm will have 2 motors, one for extending the arm out and another for extending the are
upward. The controls for these should not be too complicated, but the main issue will be ensuring that the
arm/claw to not extend past the legal limit for the robot.

Claw:
